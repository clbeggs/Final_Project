The final report is due on Dec 9 on Moodle. List group members in the report and sort the name alphabetically. You report should explain what
you did and what results you achieved.  This document should
make it clear:

* Why this project is a good (or bad) idea,
* What you did,
* Whether your technique worked or not,
* Who did what.


Please do not go over 2500 words unless you have a really good reason.
Images are a much better use of space than words, usually (there's no
limit on including images, but use judgement and be selective).

We encourage you to use the NIPS format. You can download the LaTex template [here](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020/PaperInformation/StyleFiles). We strongly recommend using LaTex, but you can use this [Microsoft word template](http://web.archive.org/web/20130424174118/http://media.nips.cc/Conferences/2013/Styles/nips2013.docx) from 2013.
**All submissions must be in PDF format.**

The final report will be evaluated based on the following aspects:

* Writeup: Does the writeup explain what you did in a way that is clear and effective?

* Technical Soundness: Did you use the appropriate tools for the problem? Were they relevant to this class?

* Effort: The amount of effort that you spend in the process.

* Performance: How did your techniques perform?

Tips to get your report better:

* Show that you understand the data and the task.

* Provide a baseline that puts what you did in context.

* Provide an error analysis.  An error analysis must contain examples from the
  development set that you get wrong.  You should show those examples
  and explain why (in terms of features or the model) they have the
  wrong answer.  You should have been doing this all along as your
  derive new approaches, but this is your final inspection of
  your errors. The feature or model problems you discover should not
  be trivial features you could add easily.  Instead, these should be
  features or models that are difficult to correct.  An error analysis
  is not the same thing as simply presenting the error matrix, as it
  does not inspect any individual examples.

* Explain the motivation for your approaches.  For example, features shouldn't come out of nowhere; you should have a clear domain-specific story for how you derived the features or an error analysis motivations for the features you create.
